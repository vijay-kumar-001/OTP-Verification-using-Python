# OTP-Verification-using-Python
OTP Verification is the process of verifying a user by sending a unique password so that the user can be verified before completing a registration or payment process. Most of the time, we get an OTP when we make an online payment, or when we forget our password, or when creating an account on any online platform. Thus, the sole purpose of an OTP is to verify the identity of a user by sending a unique password.


This Python script demonstrates a simple OTP (One-Time Password) verification system. The script generates a random 6-digit OTP, simulates sending it to a phone number, and then verifies the entered OTP. It can be used as a starting point for implementing OTP-based authentication in projects.
